0.010   2021-07-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium; Backward-Incompatible: yes

        - [incompatible change] Make result into a hash that contains all the
          info we need. Continuing with 0.009, this change also allows the
          result of resolve_schema() to be usable for future/varied needs, e.g.
          support for validator caching in upcoming Data-Sah.

        - Add option: allow_base_with_no_additional_clauses.

	  key of this hash.

        - [removed] Remove option 'return_intermediates' (we now always return
	  intermediates.
